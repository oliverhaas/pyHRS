More or less complete, works in all tested cases like a charm. Source
code is fairly well commented. Examples, maybe some small bugfixes
and some explanations/documentation will follow.


The module to calculate stopping power and straggling effects -- dedx -- is heavily inspired by ATIMA (see http://web-docs.gsi.de/~weick/atima/). It contains the same corrections, but with more recent calculation methods/numbers. And same as ATIMA it does not contain charge-exchange straggling, which I will try to include soon.
